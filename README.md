A repo for an DOD wide DSN to commercial conversion app.

DSN phone numbers are part of our everyday life as military members. Sometimes not having access to the right conversion outside of the office can be very frustrating. With DSN Europe you can dial a DSN number right from your cell phone and our algorithm will make the necessary conversion to a commercial phone number.
